# Assignment B1 and B2 
### By Jia He(Janet) Zhang 

This repository was created for 2 assignments (assignment B1 and B2) of STAT545B about creating functions. Currently only assignment B1 is available. In the assignment B1, a function for plot is made. The assignment folder includes the .rmd and .md files of each project. Sufficient comments, descriptions, and explanations of the codings are included in each file to help the audience understand.

If you just want to explore the codings, you can download the .rmd files, and run the codings yourself in Rstudio. Packages (ex: dplyr, tidyverse...etc) will need to be installed before running the codes. The .md files do not allow you to run the codes, but if you just want to scan through the different codes used and the graphs plotted in data analysis, you can just open the .md files and enjoy.

Thank you!:tada:
