# demoNEW
new demo for practice 

This is specifically for Sept 13th Stat545A 

Always rememebr to start new project 

Save changes first on R Studio --> Commit under "Git" --> Then PUSH (UP signal)
Remember to select the file under the "Git"

To pull from Github website --> submit changes on GitHub 

And then just Pull (no need to do other things) on the Rstudio 

Non conflicting changes: submit changes on the GitHub first, and then the same change on Rstudio --> sync


If the changes on GitHub and the Rstudio are different, a conflict will come up. 
GitHub notices the conflicts between Rstudio and Git if the changes are different. 

To resolve conflicts manually, delete the conflict dividers (so just the command are left). 
Click the blue square next to readme, so the blue square becomes a check
Then commit, and push. 
Now Github and Rstudio are the same. 

Create new branch on the RStudio by clicking on the branch icon on top right. And then Push. So the branch will be made on GitHub. 

Add new branch on the GitHub. And then Pull on Rstudio, now Rstudio will have the same branch as well.
